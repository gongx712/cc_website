    Description  
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a simple treasure hunt game. The thing I want to express about me is that usually I don’t directly find what I want to do in my life. Instead, I try to figure out what I don’t like and try to avoid them.   
    </p>
    <p>
        So in this game, bombs represent the thing I don’t like in my life.
The rule of the game is to avoid bombs and find the treasure box. You can move the mouse to see where the bombs are and move to the center of any square and press the mouse to dig.

If you dig a treasure box, there might be treasure in it or not.
