    Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have a habit to record my expense, so I recorded the expense data of a week.
        The length of the rectangles represent the amount of the expense of one day. I use color to divide days. When the mouse is on the rectangle, the number of the expense will show on the lower right side of the canvas.
